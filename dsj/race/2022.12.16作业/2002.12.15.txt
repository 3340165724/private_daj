-- 1）统计各个地区下学生人数
SELECT s.address , COUNT(s.address)
FROM tb_student AS s
GROUP BY s.address

-- 2）统计各个地区下学生人数top5，按降序排列
SELECT s.address , COUNT(s.address) AS c
FROM tb_student AS s
GROUP BY s.address
ORDER BY c DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- 3）统计各个班级下的人数，按人数降序排列
SELECT c.cname , COUNT(c.cname)
FROM tb_student AS s 
INNER JOIN tb_class AS c ON s.scid=c.cid
GROUP BY c.cname
ORDER BY COUNT(c.cname) DESC

-- 4）统计各个学校下的人数Top3，按人数降序排列
SELECT c.school , COUNT(c.school)
FROM tb_class AS c
INNER JOIN tb_student AS s ON c.cid=s.scid
GROUP BY c.school
ORDER BY COUNT(c.school) DESC


-- 5）统计各个地区下学生人数，并且进行排名（额外增加一列排名列）row_number()排名函数，一般需要配合over()开窗限制范围
 
-- 统计各个地区下学生人数
SELECT s.address , COUNT(s.address) AS rs
FROM tb_student AS s
GROUP BY s.address

SELECT * , ROW_NUMBER() over(ORDER BY rs DESC) AS seq
FROM (
			SELECT s.address , COUNT(s.address) AS rs
			FROM tb_student AS s
			WHERE address != ''
			GROUP BY s.address
			) AS t1
